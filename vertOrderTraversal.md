# Vertical Order Traversal of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes values.

For each node at position (X, Y), its left and right children respectively will be at positions (X-1, Y-1) and (X+1, Y-1).

Running a vertical line from X = -infinity to X = +infinity, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing Y coordinates).

If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.

Return an list of non-empty reports in order of X coordinate.  Every report will have a list of values of nodes.



Example 1:



Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation:
Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).
Example 2:
 


Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
However, in the report "[1,5,6]", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.


Note:

The tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
Each node's value will be between 0 and 1000.

var verticalTraversal = function(root) {
    if(root == null) return [];
    let queue = [[root, 0, 0]];
    let valMap = new Map();

    while(queue.length > 0){
        let curr = queue.shift();
        if(!valMap.has(curr[1])){
            valMap.set(curr[1], [[curr[0].val, curr[2]]]);
        }else{
            valMap.get(curr[1]).push([curr[0].val, curr[2]]);
        }
        if(curr[0].left != null){
            queue.push([curr[0].left, curr[1] - 1, curr[2] - 1]);
        }
        if(curr[0].right != null){
            queue.push([curr[0].right, curr[1] + 1, curr[2] - 1]);
        }
    }

    let newMap = new Map([...valMap.entries()].sort(
        function(a,b){
        return a[0] - b[0];
        }
    ));

    let keys = Array.from(newMap.keys());
    let result = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++){
      let values = newMap.get(keys[i]).sort(
        function(a,b){
          if(a[1] != b[1]){
            return b[1] - a[1];
          }

          return a[0] - b[0];
        }
      );
      let arrToPush = [];
      for(let j = 0; j < values.length; j++){
        arrToPush.push(values[j][0]);
      }
      result.push(arrToPush);
    };  
    return result;
