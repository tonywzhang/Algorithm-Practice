# Two Sum II

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
 
```
var twoSum = function(numbers, target) {
    let numSet =  new Set();

    for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
        if (numSet.has(numbers[i])){
            let resultArray = [];
            for (let j = 0; j < i; j++){
                if (target - numbers[i] == numbers[j]){
                    resultArray.push(j+1);
                    resultArray.push(i+1);
                    return resultArray;
                }
            }
        }
        numSet.add(target-numbers[i]);
    }
};
```
